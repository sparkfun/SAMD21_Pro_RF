The [SparkFun SAMD21 Pro RF](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14916) is the fated meeting of a SAMD21 and a long-range [RFM95W LoRa®-enabled radio](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/9/6/1/0/RFM95W-V2.0.pdf). The outcome is a compact, blazing fast MCU with excellent point to point data transmission in the 915MHz ISM band with LoRa Capabilities. The SAMD21 Pro RF comes with a LiPo connector, an on-board LiPo charger, and a slide switch to power the board on and off. The board programs over a reinforced Micro-B connector with a slim reset button that fits nicely on the side of the board. We’ve even added our popular [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) connector to the edge of the board making it incredibly easy to add sensors and actuators without the need for solder or a soldering iron!
